                    <p>From the time you contact me, there will be no surprises. For larger projects, if you have questions about what you
                        might need done, we can set up a time and I’ll assess your needs and provide consultation. Site assessments can be done
                        in person or virtually, depending on your needs and comfort level.</p>
                    <p>When I have an appointment with you, I will be there on time. I come equipped with all necessary tools and
                        specialized equipment, and have the ability to transport supplies to the site in my enclosed trailer.</p>
                    <p>I am fully insured to protect your property and the important people (and pets!) under its roof.</p>
                    <p>All work is 100% guaranteed - I will make sure that you are completely satisfied. If something isn’t quite what you
                        had imagined or hoped, I will work with you until it meets or exceeds your expectations.</p>
                    <p>I will be sure to keep your space safe and tidy while I am working there, and I will leave it clean when the job is
                        done.</p>
