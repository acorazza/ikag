                    <p>After a long career in healthcare and management, I decided to turn my passion into a new career and launch I Know a
                        Guy. For years, when not repairing or building something at home, I was helping friends and family with my skills. My
                        attention to detail and commitment to satisfaction are priorities for me. I have an appreciation for high quality finish
                        and a commitment to delivering the same to homeowners.</p>
                        <p>Building relationships with homeowners is my number one goal. I am committed to listening to
                    your needs and providing honest, open communications about what I recommend and what you can expect through all phases
                    of your project or repair, however big or small.</p>
